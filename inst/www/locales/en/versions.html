<h1 class="aboutheader">Versions</h1>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>April 2021 - Version 4.0</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Desktop versions for Windows and Macintosh developed</li>
	<li>Translation of the interface into French, Portuguese and Spanish</li>
	<li>Correction to summary measure formulas:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Correct use of reference subgroup in the calculation of MDBU and MDBW</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Several other fixes to software functionality</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>April 2020 - Version 3.0 (beta)</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>The source code has been completely restructured to improve perform. This included dividing the application into four R packages: heat, heatplus, heatdata, and heatmeasures. These packages handle validating and bundling the built-in database in HEAT and uploaded databases in HEAT Plus, generating interactive charts within the application and static charts for download, and contain all the modules used to build and run HEAT and HEAT Plus.</li>
	<li>The interface has been entirely redesigned to enhance user friendliness:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>The home page now allows users to vertically scroll through information</li>
		<li>Disaggregated data and summary measure views under "Explore inequality" and "Compare inequality" have been separated into two distinct sections</li>
		<li>Graphs showing disaggregated data under "Explore inequality" have been divided into two separate views: horizontal line graphs and vertical bar graphs</li>
		<li>Graphs showing summary measures under "Explore inequality" have been divided into two separate views: line graphs and bar graphs</li>
		<li>In all views, graph/map/table options are now found under a separate tab of the side panel</li>
		<li>In all views, download options are now found under a separate tab of the side panel</li>
		<li>In all views under "Compare inequality", benchmark options are now listed in a separate tab in the side panel</li>
		<li>In horizontal bar graphs showing disaggregated data under "Explore inequality", special summary measure calculations are now listed in a separate tab in the side panel</li>
		<li>Graph facet layouts have been redesigned with css grid and flexbox</li>
		<li>Color palettes have been updated</li>
	</ul>
	<li>New features have been added to allow for greater customization:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>A manage data modal has been added that enables users to upload, save, modify and delete datasets</li>
		<li>Table views have been added for disaggregated data and summary measures under "Compare inequality"</li>
		<li>Graph options now include the option to show/hide data labels, control the size of data labels and choose the number of decimals</li>
		<li>Graph options for horizontal bar graphs showing disaggregated data under "Explore inequality" now include the option to show/hide 95% confidence intervals</li>
		<li>Graphs options for scatterplots showing summary measures under "Compare inequality" now include the option to show data points as setting labels in addition to points or ISO3 labels and control the size of data labels</li>
		<li>Benchmark options under "Compare inequality" now automatically select comparison settings given the chosen country income groups and WHO regions</li>
	</ul>
	<li>In addition to the downloadable desktop version, the online version of HEAT Plus has been developed, which is accessible on the web and allows users to securely login and safely upload and store their data online</li>
	<li>A new data validation tool has been developed to facilitate the preparation of datasets for upload to HEAT Plus</li>
	<li>Correction to summary measure formulas:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Division of MDBU and MDMU by number of observations (n)</li>
		<li>Multiplication of RCI by 100</li>
		<li>Multiplication of MLD and TI by 1000</li>
	</ul>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>December 2018 - Version 2.0</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Incorporation of interactive visuals (replacing static graphs).</li>
	<li>Incorporation of a translation feature.</li>
	<li>Calculation of additional summary measures of inequality for non-ordered dimensions, including</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Between-group standard deviation (BGSD),</li>
		<li>Coefficient of variation (COV),</li>
		<li>Unweighted mean differnce from best performing subgroup (MDBU),</li>
		<li>Unweighted mean difference from mean (MDMU).</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Revision of summary measure formulas for</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Slope index of inequality (SII),</li>
		<li>Relative index of inequality (RII).</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Incorporation of additional summary measures of inequality in the "Explore inequality" - Disaggregated data (detailed bar graphs) tab, calculated for non-ordered dimensions with more than</li>

		<ul>
			<li>Difference between percentile 80 and percentile 20,</li>
			<li>Ratio of percentile 80 to percentile 20,</li>
			<li>Differnce between the mean estimates in quintile 5 and quintile 1,</li>
			<li>Ratio of the mean estimates in quintile 5 to quintile 1.</li>
		</ul>
		<li>60 subgroups:</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Difference between percentile 90 and percentile 10,</li>
			<li>Ratio of percentile 90 to percentile 10,</li>
			<li>Differnce between the mean estimates in decile 10 and decile 1,</li>
			<li>Ratio of the mean estimates in decile 10 to decile 1.</li>
		</ul>
		<li>100 subgroups:</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Difference between percentile 95 and percentile 5,</li>
			<li>Ratio of percentile 95 to percentile 5,</li>
			<li>Differnce between the mean estimates in the top 5% and the bottom 5%,</li>
			<li>Ratio of the mean estimates in the top 5% to the bottom 5%.</li>
